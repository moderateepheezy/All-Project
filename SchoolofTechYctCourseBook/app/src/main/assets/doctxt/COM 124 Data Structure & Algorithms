Discuss concept of data structure. Explain data attributes, name value range and data types. Explain

concepts of character, fields, sub field, records and files. Explain the meaning of data structure. Discuss

symbols, relations and graph. Discuss the symbols for expressing relations among data, position relation

cell contents, record location, and transfer key. Explain the properties of graph: routes, edge, sequences,

directed and non-directed. Describe operations such as precede, less than points to, routes t6, search,

change, entry. Define sets and relation □ Define the elements of set, subsets, super sets, Universal set and

null set.* □Describe set Operations. Explain the term occupancy. Leans, empty, loose. □Distinguish and

define birth, death and changes of data. □Define a sequential list, □ Explain the differences between fixed

and variable length fields. □ Implement fixed and variable fields. Define ordered and linear list. □Explain

operations that can be performed on an ordered list: ‘append, search (including delete, sort, election and

exchange,- merge, including multi-way merge and balance merge.). Describe different types of linked list

array, double linked list, queues, stock, de-queues, trees. □ Explain the use of pointers. □ Describe storage

mapping for linked lists. Discuss tree and its properties. Explain binary tree Representation Define graph

State properties of graph: routes, queued and non-directed. Describe different types of graphs: circle,

loops, etc. Describe operations such as proceeds, less than etc. Define sorting. Explain Comparison based

sorting. Explain bubble sorting algorithm Explain selection sorting Algorithm.
